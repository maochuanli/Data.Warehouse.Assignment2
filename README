  Installation and Configuration
  -------------------

  The project is delivered as a zip file, unzipping the file into a directory is
  all for installation. 
  There are 2 configuration files need be updated before execution:
  ******************************************************************************
  env.sh | env.bat  - the JAVA_HOME variable must be set
  system.properties - the database connection properties are optional to set
                    - the meshjoin parameters are optional to set
		    - 	meshjoin.partitions=?
			stream.partition.size=?
                    - the java.sql.PreparedStatement update batch number to set
		    - 	sql.insert.batch.size=?

  Execution
  -------------------

  By default, the project is using 2 Java Derby databases to store the coutndown
  operational and data warehouse data. The zip file has a built-in derby database 
  installation. 
  0, To start the built-in derby database server: 
     <INST_PATH>/bin/startNetworkServer.sh | bat
  1, To create operational database and populate the coundown transaction data
     prepared by Dr. Muhammad Asif Naeem
     <INST_PATH>/bin/create.populate.countdown.data.sh | bat
  2, To create the data warehouse star schema:
     <INST_PATH>/bin/create.DW.star.schema.sh | bat
  3, To execute the program to extract the transaction data and load it into the 
     data warehouse:
     <INST_PATH>/bin/runETL.sh | bat
  4, To execute the OLAP queries:
     <INST_PATH>/bin/DW.OLAP.query.sh | bat
   
  For using Oracle database, 
  0, Open the Oracle SQL Developer, and connect to the AUT database using 
        user:     kqc3001
        password: warehouse
        server:   oracle2.aut.ac.nz
        port:     1521
        dbName:   msdbs
  1, Execute the <INST_PATH>/DDL/Input.DB.DDL.Oracle.sql to create the countdown 
     transaction data and populate the data
  2, Execute the <INST_PATH>/DDL/Output.DW.DDL.Oracle.sql to create Data Warehouse 
     star schema tables
  3, Update the system.properties to update the database connection properties
     to connect to Oracle database
  4, To execute the program to extract the transaction data and load it into the 
     data warehouse:
     <INST_PATH>/bin/runETL.sh | bat
  5, Execute the <INST_PATH>/DDL/Assign2.DW.Query.Oracle.sql file to make OLAP queries.

  Licensing
  ---------------------

  Please see the file called LICENSE.

  Notice
  -------------------

  For execution of the program, a Java Runtime must be installed on the local
  operating system, and the JAVA_HOME variable in env.sh | bat MUST be set before running.
 
  All Mac OSX, Windows 2008, Debian operating systemss are supported and have been tested.

  Both Derby and Oracle databases are supported and can be set for both operational and
	data warehouse databases.
    
  Troubleshooting
  -------------------

  In case the scripts provided are not working as intended, it may be caused 
  by space in the installation directory, say "H:\some dir with space\countdown"
  Try unzip the project file into a directory without space!
